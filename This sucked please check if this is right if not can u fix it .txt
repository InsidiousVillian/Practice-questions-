question 

Write the pseudocode for a program that will continue prompting a user for a
value whilst the total of all values remain less than 100. The program must keep
track of the number of times the loop executes and displays the number of
times the loop executed once the loop had finished executing.

start
    Declarations 
	num count = 0 
	num value 
	string choiceInput 
	num total = 0 
	
	while (count < 100) 
	
	    output "enter a number" 
		input value 
		
		count = count + 1
		
		output "if u want to exit, type no"
		input choiceInput 
		
		if (input == "no") 
		
		    total = value + total
		
		    output "your total is:" + total
		
		else 
		
		    output "enter another number:" 
			input value 
			
		endif 

	endwhile 
	
stop
