question 

Write the pseudocode for a program that will continue prompting a user for a
value whilst the total of all values remain less than 100. The program must keep
track of the number of times the loop executes and displays the number of
times the loop executed once the loop had finished executing.

start
    Declarations 
	num count 
	num value 
	string input 
	num total 
	
	while (count < 100) 
	
	    output "enter a number" 
		value = COnvert.ToInt32(ReadLine) 
		
		count ++ 
		
		output "if u want to exit, type no"
		input = ReadLine 
		
		if (input = no) 
		
		    total += value 
		
		    output "your total is:" + total
		
		else 
		
		    output "enter another number:" 
			value = COnvert.ToInt32(ReadLine) 
			
		endif 
	endwhile 
	
stop
