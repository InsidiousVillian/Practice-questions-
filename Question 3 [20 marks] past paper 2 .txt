Develop pseudocode for the given scenario:
A shop owner intends to raise the prices of all items in his inventory by 6% to counter
inflation. The product names are stored in an array named "Product," containing 5 elements,
which holds the names of the products.
Product array
Rice Sugar Rooibos Tea Maize Meal Milk
The prices of the corresponding items (in Rands) are stored in a parallel array called “Price”.
Price array
46.99 54.99 42.99 29.99 25.99
Ensure your pseudocode covers the following tasks:
1. Declare and populate both arrays with the product names and their corresponding
prices. Utilize a loop for this purpose and note that the provided data values are for
illustration only; avoid hardcoding them in your solution.
2. Calculate and add 6% to the existing price for each product. Store the new prices in
the “Price” array.
3. Display the product names along with their new corresponding prices.
4. Include descriptive comments in the pseudocode to explain each step thoroughly.

start 
    declaration 
	string product [] = { Rice, Sugar, RooibosTea, MaizeMeal, Milk }
	num price [] = { 46.99, 54.99, 42.99, 29.99, 25.99 }
	num percentageIncrease = 6
	count 
	
	// for loop to change values of each element in the array and loop 5 times to change all 5 numbers 
	for ( count = 0 to 5 step 1) 
	
	    price[count] = price[count] + (percentageIncrease/100) 

		count = count + 1 
	endfor 
	
	//for loop to display the new price for every element in the array aswell as the product name
	    for (count = 0 to 5 step 1) 
		
		    output "the new price for:", product[count] , "is:" , "R', Price[count] 
			
			count = count + 1 
		endfor 
		
stop
