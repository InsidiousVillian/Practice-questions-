question Suppose a customer can input the number of orders they made per month for the past year.
For instance, they may have ordered three times in the first month, once in the second
month, five times in the third month, and so forth.
Now, develop pseudocode incorporating a loop prompting the user to input the number of
orders placed each month over the past year (12 months). Compute and display the total
number of orders made by the customer during the past year. Subsequently, determine the
percentage discount they are eligible for based on the quantity of purchases they made.
