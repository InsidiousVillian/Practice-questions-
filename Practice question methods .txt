Using pseudocode, write a method that will add two numbers, and return the sum to the calling
function.
Note: The method should receive two numbers as arguments.

start 

    Declarations 
	num numberOne
	num numberTwo 
	
	output "enter the first number" 
	numberOne = Convert.ToInt32(ReadLine)
	
	output "enter the second number" 
	numberTwo = Convert.ToInt32(ReadLine)
	
	//call method
	
	CalculateSum(numberOne, numberTwo) 
	
	output " the sum of the 2 numbers is : " + sum 

stop 


CalculateSum(numberOne, numberTwo) 
    Declarations 
	num sum 
	
	sum = numberOne + numberTwo 
	
return sum
