Question 7:Modify the average calculator so a loop calculates a total
			Use an definite loop to calculate the scores (Predetermined number of times)
			Use an accumlator
start
	//Declarations of variables
		num studentScores
		num SIZE = 3
		num DIVISOR = 3
		num accumTotal = 0
		num average = 0
	
	//Prompt the user to enter values
	for index = 0 to (SIZE - 1) step 1
	
		output "Please enter the student's score:"
		input studentScores, index + 1
			
		//Calculate the total of all scores
		total = studentScores + total
		
	endfor
	
	//calculate the average
	set average = accumTotal / DIVISOR
	
	output "The average of the class is:"
	output average
