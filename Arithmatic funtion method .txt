question 

Create the logic for a program that performs arithmetic functions. Design the program to:
• contain two numeric variables
• prompt the user for values for the variables
• pass both variables to methods named sum() and difference().
Create the logic for the methods sum() and difference(); they compute the sum of and
difference between the values of two arguments, respectively. Each method should perform
the appropriate computation and display the results.

	numberOne = Convert.ToIn32(ReadLine) 
	
	output " enter the second number "
	numberTwo = Convert.ToIn32(ReadLine)
	
	// call method 
	Sum(numberOne, numberTwo) 
	
	//call method 
	difference(numberOne, numberTwo)
