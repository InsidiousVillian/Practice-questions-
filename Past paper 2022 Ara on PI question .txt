question 

Write the pseudocode for an application that will request the user to enter the radius of a circle.
The radius is the measurement from the centre of the circle to the edge of the circle. The radius
should then be passed to a method which will use the value of the radius to compute the area of a
circle. The result of the calculation should be returned to the mainline logic which should display
the area of the circle. The formula for calculating the area of a circle is:
The calculation can also be written as: A = 3.14 x (r x r)
r = radius
A = area
Ï€ = 3.14 (which is called PI)
Note: Provide appropriate comments in your pseudocode.


// Mainline
start 
    Declarations 
	num radius 
	num PI = 3.14 
	
	    output " enter the radius of a circle 
		radius = Convert.ToInt32(ReadLine) 
		
// Call CalculateArea( radius, PI ) 
CalculateArea( radius, PI ) 

        output " the area of the circle is:" + Area 
		
stop 
   
// method 
CalculateArea( radius, PI )    
	Declarations 
	num Area 
	
	Area = PI * ( radius * radius ) 
	
return Area
