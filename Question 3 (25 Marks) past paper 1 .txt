question 
The Sports Administration Management is tasked with monitoring each player's performance,
requiring them to assess player performance every six months. Points are allocated as follows:
three (3) points for each goal scored and two (2) points for a penalty.
Utilizing the data provided in Table 2, populate the arrays accordingly. Then, develop
pseudocode for an application that generates a report containing the following details:
a. Total number of points scored by the player during the first six months.
b. Average number of points scored by the player per month.
c. Month with the lowest number of points scored by the player.
d. Month with the highest number of points scored by the player.
Please ensure the use of parallel arrays in your solution.
