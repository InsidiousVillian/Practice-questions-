Question 

It was decided that if a junior soccer player (under 18) has played at least 10 games
during the year they will get a R5000 bonus. Each junior player earns a basic rate
of R24 000 per game that they play.
Using pseudocode, plan the logic for an application that will:
- Allow a staff member to enter ‘Yes’ for every game played.
- Count the number of times the user entered the value ‘Yes’.
- Determine if the player is eligible for a bonus.
- Calculate and display the salary of a player.
- Confirm with the user whether they are eligible for a bonus or not.
- Include at least four (4) meaningful comments.
