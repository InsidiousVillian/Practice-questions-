question 

Write the pseudocode for an application that will make use of a module to calculate
and display the area of a triangle. The user of the application should be prompted for
the dimensions of the triangle. The dimensions will be input in the main module and
passed to the module where the calculation will be done and the area of the triangle
displayed. Formula: Area = Â½ (height x base) 

//global declarations 
double area


start 
    
	Declarations 
	double height 
	double base 
	
    output "what is the height of the triangle" 
	height = Convert.ToInt32(ReadLine) 
	
	output "what is the base of the triangle" 
	base = Convert.ToInt32(ReadLine)
	
	// call method 
	CalculateArea(height, base) 
	
stop 

void CalculateArea(double height, double base) 


	double area = 0.5 (height * base) 
	
	output "the area of the triangle is:" + area 
	
return
