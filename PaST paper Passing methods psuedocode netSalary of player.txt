question

Write the pseudocode for an application that will pass the number of games a
player has played to a module which will calculate the net salary of a player.
A player earns R70 000 per game and as the players fall within a higher tax bracket,
they automatically pay 25% tax on their earnings. The net salary will be passed
back to the mainline logic of the application which will display the net salary of a
player.

start 
    Declaration 
	num basicSalary = 70000 
	num tax = 0.25 
	num gamesPlayed
	num threshhold = 9 
	
	
	    output "how many games have u played this year"
		gamesplayed = ReadLine 
//call CalculateNetSalary(gamesPlayed, threshhold, tax)
num CalculateNetSalary(gamesplayed, threshhold, tax)

    //loop that checks if gamesPlayed is past threshhpld or not and displays diffrent results based off of loop condition
	
    if (gamesplayed >= threshholdhreshold)
	
	    output " your NetSalary is: " NetSalarytax
	
	else if (gamesPlayed <= threshhold) 
	
	    output  " your NetSalary is: " NetSalary

// Method that Calculates the NetSalary of the player
num CalculateNetSalary(gamesplayed, threshhold, tax)
    Declarations 
	NetSalary 
	
	if (gamesPlayed >= threshhold)
	
	NetSalarytax = (threshhold * basic_salary) + ((games_played - threshholdhreshold) - (basicSalary - (basic * tax) ))
	
	else 
	
	NetSalary = gamesplayed * basicSalary
