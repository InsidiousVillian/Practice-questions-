question 

“To help students determine whether they qualify for a supplementary exam, students can enter
their final module mark and exam mark on a webpage. If the student obtained more than 30% for
their exam mark and a final mark of less than 50%, the student will be informed that he/she
qualifies for a supplementary exam.”
Q.3.1 Write the pseudocode that will prompt a user for the required information and
accurately represent the logic contained in the scenario provided at the
beginning of the question

start 
    Declaration 
	num finalMark 
	num examMark 
	
	output "enter your exam mark" 
	examMark = Convert.ToInt32(ReadLine) 
	
	output " enter your final module mark " 
	finalMark = Convert.toInt32(ReadLine) 
	
	while ( examMark >= 30 ) 
	
	    output "your exam mark is:" + examMark + "you passed !" 
		
		if ( finalMark  < 50 ) 
		
		    output "you qualify to write the supplementary test" 
		
		else if (finalMark > 50 ) 
		    output "you do not qualify to write the supplementary test" 
		 
		else if (examMark < 30) 
		    output " you failed " 
		
		endif
