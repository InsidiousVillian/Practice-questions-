"A software application prompts the user to input two numbers. After the user provides the two
numbers, the application proceeds to invoke a module to compute the average of the two
inputs. Following the calculation of the average, another module is invoked to determine
whether the average exceeds 75. If the average surpasses 75, a message reading
'Congratulations, you are in the top 5' is displayed."
Construct a flowchart for each module to be invoked. Ensure that the flowcharts accurately
depict the logic outlined in the scenario
