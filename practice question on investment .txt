question 
Create the logic for a program that calculates and displays the amount of money you would
have if you invested R5 000 at 2 percent interest for one year. Create a separate method
to do the calculation and return the result to be displayed.

start
    Declarations 
    num investment = 5000 
	num intrest = 0.2 
	
    //call CalculateMoney(investment, intrest) 
	 CalculateMoney(investment, intrest)
	 
	 output " the results are" + total 
	  
stop 

    
	CalculateMoney(investment, intrest)
	
	    Declarations
		num total 
		
		total = investment + (investment * intrest) 
		
return total 
		
		
question 

Modify the program in (a) above so that the main program prompts the user for the amount
of money and passes it to the interest-calculating method.

start 

    Declarations
	num input
	num intrest = 0.2 
	
	//call IntrestCalculating( input, intrest ) 
	IntrestCalculating( input, intrest ) 
	
	output " your total is " + total 
	
stop 

//call method 
IntrestCalculating( input, intrest ) 
	Declarations 
	num total 
	
	total = input + (input * intrest)
	
return total 


question 

Modify the program in (b) above so that the main program also prompts the user for the
interest rate and passes both the amount of money and the interest rate to the interestcalculating method.

start 
    Declarations 
	num investment 
	num intrest 
	
	output " enter your investment " 
	investment = Convert.ToInt32(ReadLine) 
	
	output " enter your interest "
	intrest = Convert.ToInt32(ReadLine) 
	
//call method 
IntrestCalculating( investment, intrest ) 

    output " your total is " total 

stop 

IntrestCalculating( investment, intrest ) 
    Declarations 
	num total 
	
	total = investment + (investment * intrest) 
	
return total
