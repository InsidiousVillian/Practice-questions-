question 

pseudocode for a program that continuously accepts:
Each salesperson’s first and last names;
The number of shifts worked in a month;
The number of transactions completed in a month and
The Rand value of those transactions.
The program must display each salesperson’s name with a productivity score.
The productivity score must be calculated by first dividing Rands by transactions and then dividing the result by shifts worked.
If the score is 50 or higher, it must be displayed followed by three asterisks.
