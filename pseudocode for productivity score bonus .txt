pseudocode for a program that accepts each salesperson’s data and displays the name and a bonus amount.
The client confirmed the bonuses will be distributed as follows:
If the productivity score is 30 or less, the bonus is R25.
If the productivity score is 31 or more and less than 80, the bonus is R50.
If the productivity score is 80 or more and less than 200, the bonus is R200.
If the productivity score is 200 or higher, the bonus is R200.
