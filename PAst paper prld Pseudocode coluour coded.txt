The sports administrators have decided to give something back to the community.
They have decided that if an individual purchases more than 10 tickets to the
event, they will give the customer 10% discount as well as donate R5000 to a local
charity.
The total amount due by the customer and confirmation of the donation needs to
be displayed on the screen.
If the customer purchases less than 10 tickets, the customer will be thanked for
their purchase.
All tickets will be sold at a flat rate of R70 per ticket.
