Question: create a program that does the factorial for the the user input

start 
	//Declarations of variables
		num usersValue
		num count = 0
		num index
		num factorTotal = 1
		
	//Prompt the user to enter the number they wish to see the factorial to
	output "Please enter the value you wish to calculate the factorial to:"
	input usersValue
	
	set index = usersValue
	
	//Create a for loop to iterate the total of the factorial using the user input as a loop control value
	while (index > 0)
		
		//Calculate the factorial for the value
		set factorTotal = (usersValue - count) * factorTotal
		set count = count + 1
		
		index = index - 1
		
	endwhile
		
	output "The factorial total for you value is:", factorTotal
	
stop
